ColorRoutes
===========

# DESCRIPTION

ColorRoutes is just a little library bundled with the necessary code to turn the output of the rake routes command from the usable but dull white and black screen to something more vivid and, more important, readable.

Based on the work at: https://github.com/nicooga/color_routes

SUPPORTED VERSIONS: 4.x

Enjoy!
